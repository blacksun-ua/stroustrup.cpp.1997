===================

Exercises from Bjarne Stroustrup's "The C++ Programming Language 3rd edition" book

Here placed only source code with solved exercises. All that compiled with g++ 4.7.2 
using "g++ -o NN NN.cpp" or "g++ --std=c++11 -o NN NN.cpp", where NN is name of file. 
It's very simle, so I've desided don't write any makefiles.
